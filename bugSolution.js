Debugging this type of Expo error often involves a systematic approach:

1. **Check Expo SDK Version:** Ensure your Expo SDK version is up-to-date.  Run `expo upgrade` to upgrade your project if needed.  Consult the Expo documentation for compatibility information on the libraries you are using.  Outdated SDK versions are a major source of these obscure issues.

2. **Examine Dependency Tree:** Analyze your `package.json` and `package-lock.json` (or `yarn.lock`) files to identify potential version conflicts between your app's dependencies and the underlying Expo libraries.  Tools like `npm ls` or `yarn why` can help you visualize the dependency tree and pinpoint conflicts.

3. **Clean and Rebuild:** Sometimes, a simple clean and rebuild resolves the problem.  Try deleting the `node_modules` folder and reinstalling your dependencies: `rm -rf node_modules && npm install` or `rm -rf node_modules && yarn install`.

4. **Test on Different Environments:**  If the error only occurs on a specific environment (e.g., iOS simulator), try running the app on another platform to isolate the problem.  This could point to platform-specific compatibility issues.

5. **Isolate the Problem Library:**  If you recently added a new library, try temporarily removing it to see if the error goes away.  This helps pinpoint the problematic dependency.

6. **Check Expo Forums and Documentation:** Search the Expo community forums and the official Expo documentation for similar error messages or solutions.  Many common issues have already been documented and solved.

7. **Simplify Your App:** Create a minimal reproducible example (MRE) that demonstrates the error. This stripped-down version will help isolate the issue more easily.

**Code Example (Illustrative Solution):**  This is a conceptual example; a specific solution would depend on the precise error.  It might involve updating a package in `package.json` to a version compatible with your Expo SDK:
```javascript
// package.json
{
  // ... other dependencies
  "expo-web-browser": "^1.0.0" // Update to a compatible version
}
```
