This error typically occurs when you try to use a feature or library in your Expo app that isn't compatible with the version of Expo you're using or with the environment (e.g., iOS simulator, Android emulator, or physical device) you're running on.  The error message itself might not always pinpoint the exact incompatibility.  It could be something as simple as a missing dependency or as complex as a conflict between libraries.

**Example Scenario:**
Let's say you're using a library that relies on a specific version of React Native that's not compatible with your Expo SDK version.  Expo manages its React Native version internally, so the incompatibility might not be immediately obvious from your package.json.

**Code Example (Illustrative):** This example demonstrates a potential situation, not a specific code that always causes this error. The actual error-causing code will depend on the specific libraries used and the Expo SDK version.
```javascript
import * as WebBrowser from 'expo-web-browser'; // Might cause issues if incompatible

// ... rest of your component
```
