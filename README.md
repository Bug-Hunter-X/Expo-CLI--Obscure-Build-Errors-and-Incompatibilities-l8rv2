# Expo CLI: Obscure Build Errors and Incompatibilities

This repository demonstrates a common yet tricky issue encountered in Expo projects: obscure build errors arising from version mismatches or subtle library conflicts.  The error isn't always directly indicative of the root cause, making debugging challenging.

## Problem
The primary problem is encountering cryptic error messages during the Expo build process that don't directly point to the source of the incompatibility.  These errors can manifest in various ways, often related to library dependencies or environmental factors (iOS simulator vs. physical device).

## Solution
The solution often involves careful review of package versions, dependency trees, and checking for compatibility across different parts of your project, environment, and Expo SDK.  The steps to find the solution are described in `bugSolution.js`.

## Reproduction Steps
1. Clone this repository.
2. Install dependencies: `npm install` or `yarn install`.
3. Attempt to run the project: `expo start`
4. Observe the error reported in the Expo CLI.  You'll likely encounter an error message similar to the ones described in `bug.js`. (Note: The error will depend on your Expo SDK version and the device/environment you use.)
